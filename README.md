#An Emotion for the Moment App

## ToDo list

* Deploy the server
* Figure out how to run two emulators with the app or deploy to the play store (requires SSL maybe?)
* Clean up unused npm packages
* Show users friend requests that they've sent
* Collect user's names during account creation
* Show users' names next to their username in the friend request page
* Add comments to code and clean out old comments
* Let users cancel a friend request/friendship
* Let users delete their account
* Move the friend hex to a CSS grid (if it's possible in REACT Native)
* Make the emoji select open immediately for a new user that has no emotion
* Update nav menu to use react-navigation ( tutorial here: https://www.raywenderlich.com/178012/react-native-tutorial-building-android-apps-javascript )
* Redirect users to the friend request show list if they try to send a friend request to a user that already sent them a friend request
* In realtime, prevent users from sending a friend request to a friend that already sent them a friend request
* Continue to style the app
